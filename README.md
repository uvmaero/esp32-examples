# esp32-examples
Examples of different features and functions specific to the ESP32 on the Arduino framework. Each of the sub-folders contains a PlatformIO project
with the example code and all of nessecary dependencies. I encourage you to explore how each of the different examples works, and how they can be used together to create more complex functionality!

# Software Requirements:
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code, the blue one, not the purple one!)
- VS Code PlatformIO Extension (this can be added from the built-in extension store)

# How to Use This Reasource:
## Step 1 - Get that Code:
First, clone the esp32-examples repository down from Github, this can be done in various ways. It's up to you to decide how you want to manage your repositories, either via Github Desktop, terminal access, through VS Code, or any combination of those. If you need help with cloning a repository or would like to learn how, check out the Tutorials Repository for guides and Github practice! 

## Step 2 - Open the Project:
To open your freshly cloned project, open the "Home" tab of the PlatformIO extension. The "Home" tab has many options and submenus, but for now press the "Open Project" button, and navigate to where you have cloned your esp32-examples repository. From here you can select which project you would like to open. If you have the oppurtunity, take some time to poke around the PlatformIO

## Step 3 - Build & Run: 


## Step 4 - Develop!:


Open a PlatformIO Home tab from the PlatformIO Extension sidebar. From the PlatformIO home tab you can press the "Open Project" button to open the 
cloned esp32_examples repo. From here you can edit and upload code to the ESP32 Dev Board using the "Build" and "Upload" buttons in the bottom bar of the screen.
