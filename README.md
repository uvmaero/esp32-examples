# esp32-examples
Examples of different features and functions specific to the ESP32 on the Arduino framework. Each of the sub-folders contains a PlatformIO project
with the example code and all of nessecary dependencies. I encourage you to explore how each of the different examples works, and how they can be used together to create more complex functionality!

# Software Requirements:
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code, the blue one, not the purple one!)
- VS Code PlatformIO Extension (this can be added from the built-in extension store)

# How to Use This Resource:
Outlined below are steps you can follow to successfully obtain and use the example code in this repository! If you have questions or if you run into any problems, feel free to stop by The Shop to get some help from a more knowledgeable member!

## Step 1 - Get that Code:
First, clone the esp32-examples repository down from Github, this can be done in various ways. It's up to you to decide how you want to manage your repositories, either via Github Desktop, terminal access, through VS Code, or any combination of those. If you need help with cloning a repository or would like to learn how, check out the Tutorials Repository for guides and Github practice! 

## Step 2 - Open the Project:
To open your freshly cloned project, open the "Home" tab of the PlatformIO extension. The "Home" tab has many options and submenus, but for now press the "Open Project" button, and navigate to where you have cloned your esp32-examples repository. From here you can select which project you would like to open. If you have the oppurtunity, take some time to poke around the PlatformIO

## Step 3 - Build & Run: 
Now that you've opened the PlatformIO project, we can look around the code and browse files. But all the examples should be functional right out of the box, lucky you! To ensure to code complies, you can press the built-in "Build" button (the small checkmark button ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38026244/191997835-09313f40-032f-4b2c-af69-8039da36c53b.png)
) in the bottom bar provided by the PlatformIO extension. To program an esp32 development board, simply plug it into your computer via a data enabled micro-usb connector. Once connect, you can press the "Upload" button (small arrow pointing to the right button ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38026244/191997964-19cd188f-39aa-40c4-a9e6-f2f2d31665c7.png)
), this will send the complied program to the esp32 and it will begin running the program as soon as it is finished uploading! To access the Serial Monitor (this is where you can find the output of all your ```Serial.println("your message here");``` statements), press Serial Monitor button in the bottom bar (this button looks like a little terminal window picture). 

## Step 4 - Develop!:
So you've got some examples up and running on esp32 development boards? Congrats! That's pretty good, but it's time to start making some changes of your own! I you want to modify an example, you can create new branch of the esp32-example repository, this way, others can see your edits and follow along with your more complex expansions! Remember, the Team Leaders are always here to help, if you come across any problems, just ask for help! We all had to start somewhere!
